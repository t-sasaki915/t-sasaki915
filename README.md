# About Me
Name: Sasaki Touma<br>
Birthday: 15 September 2006 (17 years old)<br>
My bad habit: Ignores the best practice of selecting programming languages, and uses Haskell.

#### Favourites
- Haskell
- Lisp
- Functional Programming
- Scottish accent

#### Languages I can speak
- Japanese (native)
- English (en_GB)

#### Programming Languages I can use
- Haskell

\* This is quite a problem. I need more skills, or I will be unable to get a job.
