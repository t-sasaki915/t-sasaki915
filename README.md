# About Me
Name: Toma Sasaki<br>

Major: Maths and Computer Science<br>
Residence: England and Japan (when I'm on a long holiday)<br>

#### What I can do
- Programming with Haskell

#### Languages
- ja_JP (very confident)
- en_GB (fairly confident)

#### Organisations

#### Notes
- I don't think anyone would do that, but as I'm not a skilled violinist, don't invite me to concerts as a player.
- My favourite violinist is Itzhak Perlman.
- I have a Minecraft server that you can modify the world very freely: mc.t-sasaki.net.
- I prefer Windows. MacOS and Linux are too difficult.
